## Abstract

For the development of the wireless networks the design of seamless and efficient Vertical handovers is an essential issue. Next generation wireless communications will likely rely on integrated networks consisting of multiple wireless technologies. So the integration of Vertical handovers with other wireless technologies, such as WLAN, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, UMTS or 3G, has attracted research community for the last few years. With the recent introduction of mobility management frameworks in the IEEE 802.16e standard, the performance largely depends on the capability of performing fast and seamless handover between heterogeneous networks. Seamless vertical handover between different access technologies is a great challenge as it needs to obey different performance constraints. in this thesis we proposed a new algorithm that compare cost, performance with traditional Hasswa et al’s algorithm and Omar’s algorithm . Our new proposed approach provides better performance and more exhaustive for enhancing VHO.
